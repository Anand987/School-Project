                        <p class="ml-3 AText">
                            At Saraswati Vidya Mandir, we believe that learning is an interactive process wherein each
                            student has a different disposition towards knowledge and learning.
                            Our student strength is small to allow the teachers to personalize the curriculum to a
                            child to learn the way he or she enjoys. We treat each student as distinct
                            individual with his/her own uniqueness, strengths, weaknesses and cultural diversity. We
                            believe in creating an interactive and entertaining environment that stimulates
                            the desire to be inquisitive and learn new skills and concepts. We are trusted by parents
                            of multi-cultural Indian society. We practise studentâ€“centred approach enriched
                            with activities that develop imagination, thinking and creativity. Personal care and
                            attention are the key words in our teaching methodology.
